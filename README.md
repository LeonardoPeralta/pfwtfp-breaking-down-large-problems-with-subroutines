# Breaking Down Large Problems with Subroutines

## Learning Goals

- Identify techniques for breaking down large problems

## Introduction

### Identify Techniques for Breaking Down Large Problems

* Follow the Flatiron Process!
* Methods are single purpose
* Methods names should be clear as to function
* Inputs should be meaningfully named as to purpose or type
* Return value should line up with promise implied by method name
* Implementation should be as terse as possible without appearing magical
* If the method is too long, insert a helper method to pre-filter the input
* Apply the Flatiron process recursively
